# Intro 

This repository is my submission for the 2025 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge contest, which is generously provided to the IT and cybersecurity community by SANS and Counter Hack.

I have different folders for the 13 challenges I have completed so far, split into two main folders for Act I and Act II. Within each folder is a separate markdown file for each challenge within that act.

As of the time of submission, I have completed the below challenges.
